## Functionalities
```
1. To use the application you can start by searching for a city in the text input.
2. If you resize the window (or if you access it on your mobile phone) you'll see that the background will be animated according to the country's weather.

## About
```
Simple VueJS Weather Web App.
The entire application is created in the root ("App.vue"), so I didn't use children components because the application itself is simple, so this way I didn't have to use props or states (Vuex).
The functionality of the app is pretty simple, the informations are fetched from an API and stored in an object.
