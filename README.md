Simple VueJS Weather Web App.
The whole application is made in the root ("App.vue"), so I didn't use children components.
I didn't use children components because the application itself is simple, so this way I didn't have to use props or states (Vuex).
The functionality of the app is pretty simple, the informations are fetched from an API and stored in an object.
